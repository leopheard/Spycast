Our Manifesto<br>

<a href="https://www.spymuseum.org/spycast">Spycast</a> is not conceived in a remote podcast factory, assembled on an industrial basis, and then &quot;sold&quot; by an actor reading from a script - SpyCast is an artisanal product, hand-made in Washington D.C., informed by people in the know, and consumed the world over by inquiring minds.<br>

SpyCast's sole purpose is to educate its listeners about the past, present and future of intelligence and espionage. Globalization and technological change make an informed citizenry and robust debate more important than ever. The U.S. Constitution protects our ability to pursue our mission and to reach a global audience - something for which we are grateful. This responsibility will never be outsourced to an impersonal global value chain.<br>

We are produced in the global epicenter of intelligence and espionage. We count 18 intelligence agencies, 175 embassies, and 400 think-tanks as our neighbors. We are part of the morning commute to Langley, Ft. Meade and the Pentagon. We are heard in London, Canberra, New Delhi, and yes, even Moscow, Havana and Beijing. We have a Rolodex that would make an ex-president wince. We are imitated, but never intimidated. We are 15 years strong. We are SpyCast<br>
